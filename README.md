# Zero distraction - 2018

About one month ago the <a href="https://js13kgames.com/">JS13K</a> competition started and only two days before the deadline I started working on my game.. I might have been distracted.

That's why I created this game: Go offline and complete the tasks!

The game is created with Phenomenon, my 2kb WebGL library. It's used to create the animated cubes and rainbow particles (last phase)!
